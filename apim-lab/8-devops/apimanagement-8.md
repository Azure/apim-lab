Azure API Management recommends the use of [APIOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/example-scenario/devops/automated-api-deployments-apiops) as a devops methodology for maintaining a production deployment of Azure API Management.  Please see the [hands-on-lab for APIOps](https://azure.github.io/apiops) for a complete walk through of the APIOps DevOps methodology.
