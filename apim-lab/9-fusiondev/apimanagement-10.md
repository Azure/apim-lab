The *premier* Star Wars Fan club is growing and the club officers would like to upgrade from their existing member tracking worksheet to a mobile application that would be available to their members all over the world. The members would also like to see information about their favorite Star Wars movies and characters in the application that would update as new shows and movies are released.

In this exercise, you will be using [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) with Azure API Management instance that you created [in part three](https://azure.github.io/apim-lab/apim-lab/3-addingApis/apimanagement-3-1.html) of this lab. The Excel worksheet of member profiles will serve as the primary backing data source and will be used to generate a base application. You will export the Star Wars API from API Management as a Power Platform Custom Connector so that the Canvas App can access real-time Star Wars character information. For each of the Fan Club members, you can then search the Star Wars API character data and show information about their favorite character in the Canvas App.

*Note: This exercise requires access to Power Apps Premium connectors. Sign up for a [free Developer Plan](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/developerplan/).*

### Update CORS policy

Check API Management -> Developer Portal -> Portal overview to see if CORS has been enabled globally. If it has been enabled, go to All APIs and add https://flow.microsoft.com as an allowed origin. Here's what the Portal overview will look like if CORS has been enabled:

### Create a custom connector

From the existing Star Wars API Api in Azure API Management, click the ellipsis **...** and select the **Create Power Connector** option to generate a custom connector in your Power Platform environment.

If you are unable to create a Power Connector from Azure API Management, you can also export an `OpenAPI v2 (JSON)` file that can be imported as a Custom Connector within Power Platform. You can find a sample [here](https://github.com/Azure/apim-lab/blob/updates/fusion-lab-update-testing/apim-lab/9-fusiondev/Star%20Wars%20API.swagger.json).

### View your custom connector in Power Platform

1. Go to [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/) and sign in with your organizational account.
2. Select **Data** from the left pane, and then select **Custom Connectors** to see your generated custom connector to your API Management API.

4. From here, select the pencil icon to edit the custom connector.
5. On the **Definition** screen, we need to define a search query string for people so that the Power App can search for character records by name. Select the `GetPeople` action, and in the **Request** section, select **+ Import from sample**. Enter a sample request URL with the search query string:

`https://apim-star-wars-xxxx.azure-api.net/sw/people?search=Luke`

5. In the **Response** section of the `getpeople` action, select the `200` response and then select **+ Import from sample**. Copy and paste a sample JSON response into the `Body` section of the response. Close the import panel and select **Update connector**.

Repeat this import for the `getpeoplebyid` action.

6. On the **Test** screen, create a new connection instance in the **Connections** section. You will then be redirected to the **Connections** area in Power Platform where your connection was created. Navigate back to the **Custom Connectors** page and edit the Star Wars API again. Return to the **Test** page and test each of the API actions.

```
Navigate(DetailScreen1, ScreenTransition.None);

ClearCollect(characterCollection, StarWarsAPI.getpeople({search: ThisItem.MemberFavoriteCharacter}).results);
```
