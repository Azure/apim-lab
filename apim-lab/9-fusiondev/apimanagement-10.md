# APIM Workshop - Power App Exercise

In this exercise, we will be using the Star Wars API in Azure API Management that we created in a previous exercise. We will be creating a Power Apps Canvas App that will serve as a member tracking application for the premier Star Wars Fan Club. We will use a sample data from an Excel worksheet to provide the information for the fan club members and to generate the application. We will then export the Star Wars API from API Management as a Power Platform Custom Connector so that the Canvas App can access real-time Star Wars information. For each of the Fan Club members, we can search the Star Wars API character data and show information about their favorite character in the Canvas App.

*Note: This exercise requires access to Power Apps Premium connectors. Sign up for a [free Developer Plan](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/developerplan/).*

### Create a custom connector

From the existing Star Wars API in Azure API Management, click the ellipsis **...** and select the **Create Power Connector** option to generate a custom connector in your Power Platform environment.

### View your custom connector in Power Platform

1. Go to [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/) and sign in with your organizational account.
2. Select **Data** from the left pane, and then select **Custom Connectors** to see your generated custom connector to your API Management API.
3. From here, select the pencil icon to edit the custom connector.
4. In the **Definition** screen, we need to define a search query string so that the Power App can search for records. In the **Request** section, select **+ Import from sample** and enter a sample request URL with the search query string:

`https://apim-star-wars-xxxx.azure-api.net/sw/people?search=Luke`

```
Navigate(DetailScreen1, ScreenTransition.None);

ClearCollect(characterCollection, StarWarsAPI.getpeople({search: ThisItem.MemberFavoriteCharacter}).results);
```
