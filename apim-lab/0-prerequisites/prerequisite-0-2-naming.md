## Naming conventions

Before starting to deploy any Azure services, it's important to follow a naming convention. Based on the official [documentation][az-naming-convention] we need to define a few things:

- The application name
- The environment
- The region
- The instance number

We will also add an owner property, so for the purpose of this lab the values will be:

- The application name: `hol` (for Hands On Lab)
- The environment: `dev`
- The region: `we`
- The instance: `01`
- The owner: `ms`

So we will use this convention:

```xml
<!--If the resource prefix has a dash: -->
<service-prefix>-<environment>-<region>-<application-name>-<owner>-<instance>
<!--If the resource does not allow any special caracters: -->
<service-prefix><environment><region><application-name><owner><instance>
```

For instance, for a resouce group you will name it `rg-dev-we-hol-ms-01` and for a storage account you will have: `stdevweholms01`.

> Be sure to use your own value to have unique names or use your own convention based on the [official resource abbreviations][az-abrevation]
