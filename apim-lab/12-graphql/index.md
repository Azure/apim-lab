## GraphQL

You can use API Management to manage GraphQL APIs - APIs based on the GraphQL query language. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in an API, giving clients the power to efficiently retrieve exactly the data they need. Using a GraphQL API, the client app can specify the data they need to render a page in a query document that is sent as a single request to a GraphQL service. A client app can also subscribe to data updates pushed from the GraphQL service in real time.

API Management currently supports resolvers based on HTTP API, Cosmos DB, and Azure SQL data sources to return the data for fields in a GraphQL schema. The lab covers building Synthetic GraphQL APIs from an HTTP API data source.
