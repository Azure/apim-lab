## Version and Revisions

Versions and revisions provide you with elegant means to safely manage the lifecycle of your APIs. 

Versions of APIs are differentiated by a version identifier (e.g. `v1`, `v2`, etc.) through a versioning scheme such as a version path in the URL, a header, or a query string. Multiple versions can and may often be active at the same time to provide continued service while breaking changes may be introduced in newer versions.

Revisions allow you to safely make _non-breaking_ changes to your API. Developers who consume the API can be given details about the changes. Revisions can safely be tested before being activated for your consumers. Revisions also allow you to rollback changes.
